# React Quiz App

## Introduction

Welcome to the **React Quiz App**, an interactive web application designed to provide a seamless and engaging quiz experience. This application allows users to answer a series of questions, track their progress, and receive immediate feedback. The app is built using modern web development technologies to ensure a robust, scalable, and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

### React

- React is the core framework used for building the user interface of the quiz app. React's component-based architecture allows for the creation of reusable UI components, making the development process more efficient and manageable.

### Redux Toolkit

- Redux Toolkit is used for state management within the app. It simplifies the process of managing state by providing a set of tools and best practices, making it easier to write maintainable and scalable code. The toolkit integrates seamlessly with React and helps in managing the global state of the application, including user data, quiz questions, and results.

### React Query

- React Query is used for data fetching and caching. It enables the app to manage server state with ease, providing hooks for fetching, caching, and synchronizing server data. This results in improved performance and a better user experience, as data fetching is handled efficiently and automatically updated.

### React Router DOM

- React Router DOM is used for handling client-side routing. It allows for the creation of a single-page application with multiple views, enabling smooth navigation between different parts of the quiz app without reloading the entire page. This enhances the overall user experience by providing a fast and responsive interface.

### Tailwind CSS

- Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework used for rapid UI development. It provides a highly customizable design system that allows for the creation of responsive and adaptive designs. Tailwind CSS supports both Dark Mode and Light Mode, enabling the app to automatically switch between themes based on the user's preference or system settings. This ensures a consistent and visually appealing user interface across different devices and settings.

### Additional Technologies

- **@supabase/supabase-js**: Used for interacting with Supabase, a backend as a service providing real-time capabilities and a RESTful API.
- **react-loading-indicators**: Used for displaying loading indicators in the app.
- **react-timer-hook**: Used for managing timer functionalities within the app.
- **vite**: A build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **eslint**: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.
- **prettier**: A code formatter to ensure consistent code style.
- **autoprefixer**: A plugin to parse CSS and add vendor prefixes to CSS rules.
- **postcss**: A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins.
